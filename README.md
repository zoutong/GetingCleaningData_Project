# GetingCleaningData_Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. In additon to the tidy data set attached in submission page, the following are included in this repo: 1) the R script file called run_analysis.R, 2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

The R script starts with reading in the training and test data set, and ends with an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Each step in the R script was annotated and should be easy to interpret along with the code book.  
 
The CodeBook.md file provides further details of the variables and data transformation performed in the R script.
